## How It Works

### Knowledge Base
```
Claude Project Knowledge
├── Core Framework Documentation
│   └── lumos-complete-reference.md
├── Custom Instructions
│   └── Defines Claude's Lumos expert role
└── Project Learnings (you add these)
    └── learn-YYYY-NNN-description.json
```

### Daily Workflow
```
1. You start building Webflow project
2. Claude guides implementation (using framework knowledge)
3. You encounter challenge
4. Claude helps solve it (referencing past learnings if exists)
5. You say "Log this learning"
6. Claude creates JSON learning entry
7. You save to knowledge base
8. Future projects benefit automatically
```

### Learning Capture
```
Problem → Solution → Documentation → Reusable Pattern
```

Every challenge becomes permanent knowledge.
