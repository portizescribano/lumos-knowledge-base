  "problem": {
    "description": "CMS dynamic links inside Collection List items stopped working when Collection List was wrapped in a component without proper property exposure",
    "symptoms": [
      "Dynamic links show placeholder '#' instead of CMS field data",
      "Child components don't receive CMS context",
      "Slider items show identical content instead of unique CMS data",

    "context": "Occurs when Collection List is placed inside a component slot without exposing the Collection Item as a component property. Common when creating custom slider or tab components that wrap CMS lists."
  },
  "rootCause": "Webflow components create an isolation boundary. When Collection List is wrapped in a component without exposing the Collection Item as a component property, child components lose access to the CMS data context. The component wrapper breaks the data flow chain from Collection List → Collection Item → Child Components.",
